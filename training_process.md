## Step 1: Feature Engineering

In this step, I performed feature engineering on the dataset to extract meaningful features that could potentially improve the model's performance. This involved techniques such as:

- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling numerical features

## Step 2: Data Visualization on Training Data

I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) by visualizing the training data to gain insights into the relationships between different features and the target variable (Price). Visualization techniques included:

- Histograms
- Scatter plots
- Box plots
- Pair plots

These visualizations helped in understanding the distribution of variables, identifying outliers, and discovering patterns within the data.

## Step 3: Preparing Test Data

Once the training data was preprocessed and explored, I prepared the test data for model evaluation. This involved similar preprocessing steps applied to the training data to ensure consistency and compatibility with the trained model.

## Step 4: Building Model

Finally, I built machine learning models using the preprocessed training data. I experimented with various algorithms such as:

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Regression

The models were trained using the training data and evaluated using techniques such as cross-validation and performance metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
