# Used Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning regression

This repository contains the source code for a used car price prediction. The application utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the price of a car based on various factors.

## How it Works

1. *Data Collection*: The application gathers data from various sources, including historical car sales data, current market trends, and specific details about individual cars such as make, model, year, mileage, features, and location.

2. *Data Preprocessing*: Once the data is collected, it undergoes preprocessing to clean and prepare it for analysis. This might involve handling missing values, removing outliers, and standardizing formats.

3. *Feature Selection/Engineering*: Relevant features are selected or engineered from the data that could potentially affect the price of a car. These features could include things like mileage, age of the car, brand reputation, demand for certain features, economic factors, and geographical location.

4. *Model Training*: Machine learning algorithms are then trained on this prepared dataset. Common algorithms used for price prediction include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks. During training, the model learns the relationships between the features and the target variable (car price).

5. *Model Evaluation*: The trained model is evaluated using techniques such as cross-validation to assess its performance and ensure it can make accurate predictions on new data.

6. *Deployment*: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it is deployed as part of the application. Users can input information about a car they're interested in, and the model will use its learned relationships to predict the price of that car.

7. *Feedback Loop*: The application might incorporate a feedback loop where user interactions and actual sale prices are collected to continuously improve the model's accuracy over time.
